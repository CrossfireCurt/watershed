# The Hadoop-style URL to the distributed filesystem containing the stream archives.
# Note that to use S3 directly, the URL scheme is 's3n' (not 's3'), and credentials
# must be included (EC2 Instance Roles are not supported). To avoid this, you
# could use EMRFS (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-fs.html)
# or script the credentials into the Hadoop config used by Drill.
STREAM_ARCHIVES_DFS_URL="s3n://accessKeyId:secretKeyId@stream-archival"

# Path within the above DFS to the location of stream archives. Children of this
# path will be considered as SQL "tables", beneath which any further structure
# will be considered as "table partitions".

# The directory name below ${STREAM_ARCHIVES_PATH} containing the archives of
# the stream; also used as the table name for accessing the same with Hive SQL.
